For Suitless, I see the top section as %40 informational and %60 design. The information is responsible for introducing Suitless to the user by using copy and a set of minimal interactions. Typically I would forgo tabbed/sliding/hidden information, but in this instance I see it as a nice reflection of your technical competence. The design portion is handled via typography and photography. </br></br> Below the top section is a chance to take the user on a short journey. I appropriated the existing '5 steps' on the Suitless live home page into a more blown out experience that the user pages through one screen at a time. These steps are an ideal situation for some animation. Extensive animation may not be in budget for this round of work, but it will be setup and ready when you decide to turn up your site in the future. </br></br> Each step would allow/entice users to click off to a related service or part of the site. </br></br> After the user has scrolled though the 5 steps they will be met with a big beautiful call to action(which could contain blog links too), followed by the footer. Home page out."})
