While perusing pricing page conventions and examples two things stood out to me, the interfaces are remarkably similar in their layout and the amount of information/effort seems directly proportional to the price point. What I took away from that is too borrow successful layout conventions while adding a medium to high degree of depth to aid in selling Suitless. </br></br> Your layout is fairly straightforward. It begins with a large warm message to set the mood. Prominently displayed below that is the information that users likely want most, the numbers. Next are three sections that allow you to acquaint users with Suitless a bit more(sell sell sell). Ideally these sections would have the feel of an interactive infographic, but that is likely best done in the next round or not at all as it would be pricey and mildly superfluous. Although that could just as easily be an argument in favor of it, depending on how you look at things."})
